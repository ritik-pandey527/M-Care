Solving real problems that change
people's lives
Out of a total of ~40 crore menstruating women in India, less than 20% use sanitary pads. In urban areas, this number only goes up to 52%. This indicates that nearly half of even urban-based women use unhygienic methods for period protection, making them vulnerable to health issues.
Adoption of sanitary napkins is less than 20% in the country whereas adoption of cosmetics like lipstick is significantly higher at 65%. In addition, there is still a social stigma associated with periods.
According to UNESCO’s studies, about 71% of adolescent girls in India remain unaware of menstruation until they get their first period, adversely affecting their confidence and self-esteem.
We chose to deeply research about Women’s menstrual health and hygiene in detail as it is an important step towards safeguarding the dignity, bodily integrity and overall life opportunities of women and girls especially in rural India.
We conducted an ethnography research in the villages of Punjab for understanding the problem of hygiene in more depth. We will showcase this research and our insights in the form of a of documentary that we compiled.
All the information about our movement and research is available on our website.
We currently have a team of 20 members in total including design, tech, marketing as well as survey team. We have 5 members in our design team who collect raw materials from industry as well as through donations. We also outsource pads when our demand becomes high from government as well as private partners.
